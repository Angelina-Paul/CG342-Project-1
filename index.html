         <h2>What Are They?</h2>
            <p>In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics — even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure. Some may believe ghosts appear as full body apparitions, an invisible force, or are just floating white sheets with people underneath it. What majority of people believe though is that ghosts are remnants of individuals such as people or animals, that remain after their usually untimely death.</p>

         <h2>Evidence</h2>
            <p>There has recently been some new scientific evidence which points toward the existence of ghostly phenomena. According to Danny Penman, this evidence does not say that all hauntings are real but that some are genuine. These findings were made by Dr. Barrie Colvin. Dr. Coven has spent the last five years looking at and analyzing the knocks and bangs that are supposedly made by ghosts. He has used the most advanced acoustic equipment to investigate these sounds and compare them to sounds made by people and animals. Dr. Colvin said, “The sounds produced by 'ghosts' during hauntings are paranormal. Their acoustic waveforms are completely different. I cannot find a conventional explanation for my results at all. Nor can any of the other scientists who have reviewed my work. To be honest, we are completely stumped. We did not expect to find these results” (qtd. in Penman). Obviously this new evidence opens the door for more people to believe in the existence of ghostly forms. To many people, this evidence also gives proof for the belief that there is life after death.</p>

            <p>Many photographs have been taken over the years where a ghost has shown up in the picture. Most people do not notice the ghost at the time, but the ghost later shows up in the print. When seeing the photo, most people will try to disprove the photo by attempting to recreate the picture. These people will usually then find that the photo cannot be recreated. Some personal experiences come from a person that becomes possessed by a ghost or an "evil demon." Or often people will clame to have seen a ghost or experience something that cannot be explained by the laws of reality.</p>

            <p>Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, “Places can be haunted by spirits.” And almost one in five people from the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they've seen or been in the presence of a ghost.</p>

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Many people in today's society are still in disbelief, even with seeing the photographs, knowing the personal experiences, and hearing the scientific evidence. For some, seeing the photograph of a cowboy with no legs or a deceased girl in a fire in not enough to make them believe that ghosts exist. Some do not even believe the fact that there are some ghosts who will launch things at a person or take over a person's body. There is room for skeptics in this world, but there is certainly plenty of evidence that supports the fact that ghosts do exist.</p>
